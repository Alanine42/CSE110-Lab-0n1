# Alan's User Page
Hey, Alan here. I discovered an interest in programming at CSE 8A (Yay, *Python!*) and has continued ever since. 

I taught myself *a bit of* React (JavaScript frontend) and Django (Python backend) and used them on a few projects. 

To be honest, I'd never think too seriously about the code structure or *design*. All I did was worrying too much about time complexity (good habit if you grind LeetCode). 

When I am not coding, you may find me either `(`in front of a piano `||` smashing in badminton court `||` reading sci-fi novels by Liu Cixin`)`.

# What does Markdown offer?

## Styling Text
- To make a text **bold**, wrap it with a pair of double stars. 
- To make a text *italic*, wrap it with a pair of single star.
- If you want ***both***, wrap it with a pair of 3-stars. 
- That's it. No ~~five-star hotel~~ in Markdown, unfortunately.

## Quoting Text
> You can fool some people all the time. You can fool all people some of the time. But you can't fool all people all the time. 

## Quoting Code
Use backticks to wrap your codes!

Rotate the matrix 90-degrees clockwise (in python): 

`M = zip(*M[::-1])`
